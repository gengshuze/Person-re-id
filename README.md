# Person-re-id
INFO: This is the matlab code of the paper  Shuze geng,Ming Yu, Yingchun Guo" Re-ranking Person Re-Identification with multiple metrics".  STRUCTURE: -All the main script and function codes are located under root path; -All parsed datesets are located under "dataset/"; -All additional libs and data parsing codes are located under "Assistant Code/".  HOW TO RUN THE DEMO: - Data preparation      Parsing images to appropriate format by running "load_DATASET.m" in folder "Assistant Code";     If you want to use your own data set, please refer any load function for the detail of data structure      The demo only give a example of viper dataset. If you want to use another datasets, you should extract features.  - To run the example, please start with "run_demo.m"; - Local Binary Pattern (Assistant Code/LBP)      http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Local_Binary_Patterns
